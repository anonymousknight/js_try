thala, your intervention required!
chumma saw a tutorial and tried it.
couldn't fix 2 thing.
1) If the dice image is positioned in the center and when the players turn shifts then the dice image becomes half blocked.
2)After Winning the game (scoring 20pts) I'm trying to hide the roll(press karo) button instead the hold button goes hidden.
